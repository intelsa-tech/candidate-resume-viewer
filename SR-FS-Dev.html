    <title>Senior Full Stack Developer Candidate Resumes</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Neutral Professional -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a clean, tabbed document viewer. A top navigation bar with buttons for each candidate allows the user to switch between full resume views. This structure is optimal for presenting long-form text documents like resumes within a single page, as it keeps the interface uncluttered and focuses the user's attention on one complete document at a time. This is more effective than a dashboard for this specific purpose, as the goal is in-depth review, not high-level data visualization. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Full resume text for each candidate. Goal: Inform/Organize. Viz/Presentation Method: Structured HTML with Tailwind CSS for clean typography and layout. Interaction: Clickable tabs/buttons to switch between candidate views. Justification: For presenting dense, text-based information, a well-formatted document layout is superior to charts or graphs. The primary interaction is navigation between these documents, which is handled efficiently by a simple tab system. Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind/Vanilla JS. - Report Info: Technical skills. Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation Method: Styled tags (pills). Interaction: N/A. Justification: Tags allow for quick visual scanning of key skills within the resume text. Method: HTML/Tailwind. - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
