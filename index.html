    <title>Complete Candidate Resumes</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Neutral Professional -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a clean, tabbed document viewer. A top navigation bar with buttons for each candidate allows the user to switch between full resume views. This structure is optimal for presenting long-form text documents like resumes within a single page, as it keeps the interface uncluttered and focuses the user's attention on one complete document at a time. This is more effective than a dashboard for this specific purpose, as the goal is in-depth review, not high-level data visualization. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Full resume text for each candidate. Goal: Inform/Organize. Viz/Presentation Method: Structured HTML with Tailwind CSS for clean typography and layout. Interaction: Clickable tabs/buttons to switch between candidate views. Justification: For presenting dense, text-based information, a well-formatted document layout is superior to charts or graphs. The primary interaction is navigation between these documents, which is handled efficiently by a simple tab system. Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind/Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Technical skills. Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation Method: Styled tags (pills). Interaction: N/A. Justification: Tags allow for quick visual scanning of key skills within the resume text. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p class="mb-0">This candidate's experience leading Python microservices projects (FastAPI, Django) and their knowledge of AWS and GCP deployments make them a strong fit for microservices ecosystem development and maintenance. They have key data integration experience (ETL, APIs, format transformation). While their MongoDB experience is functional, it's limited to lower complexity scenarios, suggesting a need for reinforcement in high-demand environments. Their practical ML/statistics experience is limited, but their university thesis shows solid technical fundamentals. They have relevant DevOps experience with Docker, EC2, Cloud Run, and Pulumi, covering most role requirements. Their focus on code quality and testing is appropriate. English proficiency is advanced (C1), and they have international and remote work experience.

<strong>Sentiment: </strong>The candidate was collaborative, honest, and proactive. They provided detailed answers, acknowledged limitations without exaggeration, and showed a willingness to clarify and learn. Their positive, open, and problem-solving attitude inspires confidence.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">With over 10 years of backend development experience in Python, Django, Flask, and FastAPI, this candidate significantly exceeds the 5+ years requirement for Python microservices. They have led teams, designed APIs, optimized databases, and worked with scalable cloud architectures (AWS, Azure, GCP). Their Docker and AWS deployment experience is relevant, though specific DevOps tool exposure (CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) seems limited due to previous dedicated DevOps teams. In AI/ML integration, they have worked on computer vision projects and collaborated on OpenAI initiatives, but their advanced statistics and modeling experience (regression, time-series) is less, which could be an area for development if the role heavily emphasizes statistical analysis. They have strong ETL and multi-source data handling experience with modern tools and best practices. Their focus on code maintainability, testing, and consistency is well-suited for existing and multi-language codebases. English proficiency is sufficient (C1), and their customer-facing and collaborative work experience aligns with the role.
<br>
<strong>Sentiment: </strong>The candidate displayed a collaborative, open, and professional attitude. They were confident discussing their areas of expertise (Python, backend, basic DevOps, ETL, AI/ML) but were honest about lesser experience in advanced statistics. Their tone was positive, receptive to questions, and willing to clarify or elaborate. Overall, the interview reflected confidence, a willingness to learn, and good adaptability.</p>
